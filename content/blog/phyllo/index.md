## Building for the Creator Economy

The creator economy is not just about the MrBeasts and Kylie Jenners of the world.

The creator economy tailwinds are as much an [enterprise](https://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1169753411639640064) trend as it is a consumer one.

Suppose you’re a developer who needs creator data to build great products. The status quo today is to integrate with the public APIs (if they exist) of the creator platforms one by one or to write custom scrappers, if these platforms don’t provide public APIs. Not the ideal developer experience.

## There's an API for that

Abstracting away the messy, the repetitive, and the complicated is API's raison d'etre.

Think of [Phyllo](https://getphyllo.com)'s APIs as the digital plumbing between the walled gardens of creator platforms and the developers building for the creator economy.

Phyllo’s developer friendly APIs democratize access to verified and creator-consented identity, engagement, and income data.

Phyllo’s platform coverage spans social, monetization, commerce, freelance, gaming, and web3. Irrespective of whether these platforms provide public APIs or not, Phyllo provides you with a single, secure datapipe from hundreds of platforms through a single API.

Phyllo raised a [$15 million Series A](https://www.getphyllo.com/post/weve-raised-15m-to-transform-data-access-in-the-creator-economy-and-web3) to fuel its mission of enabling creators to scale as businesses and empowering organizations with digital infrastructure necessary to unlock the [creator middle class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class).

## Why I joined Phyllo

1. ‘Infra plays’ excite me and I’m a sucker for startups building infrastructure APIs.

Infrastructure companies tend to spawn more startups. I can see Phyllo following Plaid’s playbook to catalyze the next generation of creator economy startups.

Creators’ needs are not one-size-fits-all, consequently no one creator platform can realistically aspire to solve pain points across all the [levels of the creator economy](https://future.a16z.com/creator-economy-levels/). Developer tools are the enablers for such a la carte, niche products and services catering to specific creator needs.

2. Phyllo is poised to ride the “third wave of the internet”. [^1]

> from [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/12/technology/content-creators-venture-capital.html):
<br> The next step is for creators to build, operate and own the products and platforms they rely on. The online influencer culture is starting to draw serious interest from big venture capital firms. But the real money could be in digital tools, not the personalities. But as the saying goes, don’t invest in the gold miners — sell them their tools. Silicon Valley appears far more interested in the digital tools and platforms used by the content creators than investing directly in the creators themselves.

3. Last but not least, Phyllo’s incredible (remote first) team. And yes, we’re [hiring](https://getphyllo.recruitee.com/).

The third wave, he argues, is direct-to-creator spend, via platforms like Substack, OnlyFans, Roblox or Cameo.
