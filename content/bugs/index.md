    problem="concurrent requests caused a database integrity violation."
    cause="the check and insert logic in the application code wasn't atomic, allowing concurrent requests to break the uniqueness integrity expected by the application code. solution: use atomic upsert in the application code instead."
    notes="correlation ids from production alerts pointed to failing requests, but those werenâ€™t the ones that caused the integrity issue. searching logs for the successful concurrent requests that put the database into the inconsistent state cut the time to identify the issue."
