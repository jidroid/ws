# Hey, Iâ€™m Jidin ðŸ‘‹

I'm a backend software engineer interested in databases, distributed systems, and machine learning. I currently work as a Product Manager at [Phyllo](https://jidin.co/phyllo), building data infrastructure for the creator economy. 

I'm counting on the serendipity of the internet to meet new and interesting folks. [Hit me up](mailto:hi@jidin.co) (I won't bite), if you think making friends as adults is hard :)
