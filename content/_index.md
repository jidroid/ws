*I am*

* currently a product manager at [Phyllo](https://jidin.co/phyllo), building data infrastructure for the creator economy. 

* also a backend software engineer passionate about distributed systems. 

* bullish on the emergence of biology as the next great computing platform. 

* a sucker for good coffee, snapbacks, and sneakers.

* learning a bit of biology, psychology, economics, mimetic theory, and poker this year.

### I'm counting on the serendipity of the internet to meet new and interesting folks. 

Hit me up (I won't bite), if you think making friends as adults is hard :)
