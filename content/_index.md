ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jidin.

*I am*

* currently a product manager at [Phyllo](https://jidin.co/phyllo), building data infrastructure for the creator economy. 

* also a backend software engineer interested in databases, distributed systems, and machine learning. 

* a sucker for good coffee, snapbacks, and sneakers.

### I'm counting on the serendipity of the internet to meet new and interesting folks. 

Hit me up (I won't bite), if you think making friends as adults is hard :)
