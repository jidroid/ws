# Hey, Iâ€™m Jidin ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Product Manager at [Phyllo](https://jidin.co/phyllo), building data infrastructure for the creator economy. I'm passionate about databases, distributed systems, machine learning, and books. 

I'm counting on the serendipity of the internet to meet new and interesting folks. If you think making friends as adults is hard, [hit me up](mailto:jd@jidin.co) â€“ I wonâ€™t bite :)
